XboxBuddy -- Twitter for gamers! Instead of Tweets, your Timeline shows in-game achievements that you and your friends have recently unlocked playing Xbox video games. XboxBuddy also supports the social networking features you expect (but which are not available via Xbox Live) including Likes, Comments, Invitations, Push Notifications, and more.
